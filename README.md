# Title: The Bank Queue (Poisson) Simulator

Project Brief:

You are a data analyst for a bank. Customers are complaining about long wait times. The bank manager wants to know if they need to hire another teller, but hiring is expensive. They need data, not guesses.

Your Goal:

Build a C program that simulates a bank queue for an 8-hour day (480 minutes). Your simulation must be realistic, using probability to model customer arrivals. The final output must be a report on the average and maximum customer wait times.



## Concepts Used:

C programming :
> for loops
> pointers
> malloc()
 
maths :
> poisson distribution 
> mean 
> median
> mode
